# QGD-OE: Quaternion Gradient Descent Algorithm for IMU Orientation Estimation

## Overview
The **Quaternion Gradient Descent for IMU Orientation Estimation (QGD-OE)** algorithm provides an efficient and accurate method for estimating the orientation of an **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**. It is designed to solve **Wahbaâ€™s Problem**, a fundamental challenge in attitude determination, where the objective is to find the optimal orientation given a set of vector measurements.

This repository includes:

- A **C++ implementation** of the QGD-OE algorithm as described in our paper:
 
     - **"QGD-OE: Quaternion Gradient Descent Algorithm for IMU Orientation Estimation,"** published in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement (Volume: 74).

- A **Python implementation** for performance analysis, as presented in our paper:

     - **"Performance Comparison of Real-Time Algorithms for IMU-based Orientation Estimation,"** published in the Proceedings of the European Wireless 2023; 28th European Wireless Conference, Rome, Italy, 2023, pp. 162-167.


## QGD-OE Algorithm Key Features
The QGD-OE algorithm is based on a gradient descent approach in the quaternion domain, optimizing orientation estimation by iteratively minimizing errors. The method computes accelerometer and magnetometer gradients directly in the quaternion field using generalized Hamilton-real algebra, ensuring greater accuracy. This makes the algorithm highly robust and suitable for real-time applications in fields such as robotics, navigation, and tracking.
